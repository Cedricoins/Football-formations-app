Objective: to generate (or iterate through) all possible combinations of player positioning on a pitch (configurable grid), using a web interface. A Solidity smart contract allows us to save the hash of a formation (avoiding the need to store complete formations in a chain to save cost).

Important: the number of combinations grows rapidly. This project includes:

- Off-chain generation via a serverless API (Vercel)

- Pagination/limiting to prevent exceeding the limit

- React frontend (using Tailwind classes) to display a field and combination pages
- Minimal Solidity contract to "register"/verify a training hash

Included files (in this document):

- contracts/FormationManager.sol (Solidity)
- api/combinations.js (Vercel serverless function, Node.js)
- package.json (dependencies for development/deployment)
- src/App.jsx (React component - default export)

Quick Start Notes:

1) Deploy the contract (optional) via Hard Hat/Foundry, etc. (Address and ABI can be added to the frontend if you want to save hashes)
2) Deploy the API on Vercel (the api/combinations.js file in /api)
3) Deploy the frontend (React) on Vercel or locally.

Default limits in the code:

- Field: rows=6, cols=4 -> 24 cells by default
- Number of players (k): 4 by default to prevent overload
- The API accepts the following query parameters: rows, columns, players, page (zero-based), limit
